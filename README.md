# Personal_Address_Book

A Personal Address Book is a simple application designed to store and manage contact information for individuals. It typically allows users to add, edit, delete, and view details of people in their address book. The stored information usually includes:

- Name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Physical address
- Additional notes or categories (such as birthdays, organization, etc.)

The address book is organized in a way that makes it easy to search and retrieve contacts, often by name or other key fields. Users can sort contacts alphabetically or group them based on categories (e.g., family, work, friends).

This digital address book offers the convenience of accessing and managing contact information in one place, helping users stay organized and maintain important personal and professional connections.
